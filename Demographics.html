          At the beginning of 2022, Italy had an estimated population of 58,9
          million. Its population density, at 197 inhabitants per square
          kilometre (510/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European
          countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely
          uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (which
          contains about a third of the country's population) in northern Italy
          and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern
          Italy, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the
          plateaus of Basilicata, the Alps and Apennines highlands, and the
          island of Sardinia.

          Roman Catholicism is the largest religion in the country, although the
          Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion. In 2006,
          87.8% of Italy's population self-identified as Roman Catholic,
          although only about one-third of these described themselves as active
          members (36.8%). In 2016, 71.1% of Italian citizens self-identified as
          Roman Catholic. This increased again to 78% in 2018. Most Italians
          believe in God or a form of spiritual life force. According to a
          Eurobarometer Poll in 2005: 74% of Italian citizens responded that
          'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there
          is some sort of spirit or life force,' and 6% answered that 'they do
          not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force.' There
          are no data collected through the census.

          Italian art has influenced several major movements throughout the
          centuries and has produced several great artists, including painters,
          architects and sculptors. Today, Italy has an important place in the
          international art scene, with several major art galleries, museums and
          exhibitions; major artistic centres in the country include Rome,
          Florence, Venice, Milan, Turin, Genoa, Naples, Palermo, Lecce and
          other cities. Italy is home to 58 World Heritage Sites, the most
          significant number of any country in the world. Since ancient times,
          Greeks, Etruscans and Celts have inhabited the south, centre and north
          of the Italian peninsula, respectively. The very numerous rock
          drawings in Valcamonica are as old as 8,000 BC, and there are rich
          remains of Etruscan art from thousands of tombs and rich remains from
          the Greek colonies at Paestum, Agrigento and elsewhere. Ancient Rome
          finally emerged as the dominant Italian and European power. The Roman
          remains in Italy are of extraordinary richness, from the grand
          Imperial monuments of Rome to the survival of exceptionally preserved
          ordinary buildings in Pompeii and neighbouring sites. Following the
          fall of the Roman Empire in the Middle Ages, Italy, especially the
          north, remained an important centre, not only of the Carolingian art
          and Ottonian art of the Holy Roman Emperors but for the Byzantine art
          of Ravenna and other sites. Italy was the main centre of artistic
          developments throughout the Renaissance (1300-1600), beginning with
          the Proto-Renaissance of Giotto and reaching a particular peak in the
          High Renaissance of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael, whose
          works inspired the later phase of the Renaissance, known as Mannerism.
          Italy retained its artistic dominance into the 17th century with the
          Baroque (1600-1750). Cultural tourism and Neoclassicism (1750-1850)
          became a central prop to an otherwise faltering economy. Baroque and
          Neoclassicism originated in Rome and were the last Italian-born styles
          that spread to all Western art. However, Italy maintained a presence
          in the international art scene from the mid-19th century onwards, with
          cultural movements such as the Macchiaioli, Futurism, Metaphysical,
          Novecento Italiano, Spatialism, Arte Povera, and Transavantgarde.

        <h3>Languages</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="cardImg"></div>
      <div id="cardText">
        Italy's official language is Italian; Ethnologue has estimated that
        there are about 55 million speakers of Italian in the country and a
        further 6.7 million outside of it, primarily in the neighboring
        countries and the Italian diaspora worldwide. Italian, adopted by the
        central state after the unification of Italy, is a language based on the
        Florentine variety of Tuscan and is somewhat intermediate between the
        Italo-Dalmatian languages and the Gallo-Romance languages. Its
        development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the
        post-Roman invaders. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the
        population spoke Italian, even though an estimated 90% of Italians
        nowadays speak Italian as their L1. As a way to distance itself from the
        Italianization policies promoted because of nationalism, Italy
        recognized twelve languages as the Country's "historical linguistic
        minorities,” which are promoted alongside Italian in their respective
        territories. French is co-official in the Aosta Valley as the province's
        prestige variety, under which the more commonly spoken Franco-Provencal
        dialects have been historically roofed. German has the same status in
        the area of South Tyrol as in some parts of that province and in regions
        of the neighboring Trentino does Ladin. Slovene and Friulian are
        officially recognized in Trieste, Gorizia, and Udine in Venezia Giulia.
        In Sardinia, the Sardinian language has been the language traditionally
        spoken and is often regarded by linguists as constituting its branch of
        Romance; in the 1990s, Sardinian was recognized as "having equal
        dignity" with Italian, the introduction of which to the island
        officially started under the rule of the House of Savoy in the 18th
        century.

          Italian cuisine includes deeply rooted traditions common to the whole
          country, as well as all the regional gastronomies, different from each
          other, especially between the north, the centre and the south of
          Italy, which are in continuous exchange. Many dishes that were once
          regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.
          Italian cuisine offers excellent taste and is one of the most popular
          and copied worldwide. The cuisine has influenced several other
          cuisines worldwide, chiefly that of the United States. One of the main
          characteristics of Italian cuisine is its simplicity; with many dishes
          made up of few ingredients, Italian cooks often rely on the quality of
          the ingredients rather than the complexity of preparation. Italian
          cuisine originates from a turnover of more than €200 billion
          worldwide. The most popular dishes and recipes, over the centuries,
          have often been created by ordinary people more so than by chefs,
          which is why many Italian recipes are suitable for home and daily
          cooking, respecting regional specificities, privileging only raw
          materials and ingredients from the region of origin of the dish and
          preserving its seasonality. The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of
          Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables. Cheese,
          cold cuts and wine are central to Italian cuisine and, along with
          pizza and coffee (especially espresso), form part of Italian
          gastronomic culture. Desserts have a long tradition of merging local
          flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet
          cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes such as cocoa,
          vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato, tiramisu and cassata are the most famous
          examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie. Italian cuisine
          relies heavily on traditional products; the country has many
          traditional specialities protected under EU law. Italy is the world's
          largest producer of wine, as well as the country with the widest
          variety of indigenous grapevine varieties in the world.

          The Italy national football team (Italian: Nazionale di Calcio dell
          Italia) has represented Italy in international football since its
          first match in 1910. The national team is controlled by the Italian
          Football Federation (FIGC), the governing body for football in Italy,
          which is a co-founder and member of UEFA. Italy's home matches are
          played at various stadiums throughout Italy, and its primary training
          ground and technical headquarters, Centro Tecnico Federale di
          Coverciano, is located in Florence. Italy is the reigning European
          champions, having won UEFA Euro 2020. Italy is one of the most
          successful national teams in the history of football and the World
          Cup, having won four titles (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006) and appearing in
          two other finals (1970, 1994), reaching third place (1990) and a
          fourth place (1978). Italy also won two European Championships (1968,
          2020) and appeared in two other finals of the tournament (2000, 2012).
          Italy's team also achieved second place at the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of
          Champions in 2022, third place at the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013,
          and at the UEFA Nations League in 2021. The team is known as gli
          Azzurri (the Blues) because Savoy blue is the standard color of the
          national teams representing Italy, as it is the traditional paint of
          the royal House of Savoy, which reigned over the Kingdom of Italy. In
          1938, Italy became the first team to defend its World Cup title, and
          due to the outbreak of World War II, retained the title for a further
          12 years. Italy had also previously won two Central European
          International Cups (1927-30, 1933-35). Between its first two World Cup
          victories, Italy won the Olympic football tournament (1936). After
          most of the team was killed in a plane crash in 1949, Italy obtained
          poor results in the 1950s, failing to qualify for the 1958 World Cup.
          Failure to qualify for the World Cup did not happen again until the
          consecutive editions of 2018 and 2022. The team was unbeaten from
          October 2018 to October 2021 and held the world record for most
          consecutive matches without defeat (37). Italy has notable rivalries
          with other footballing nations, such as Brazil, Croatia, France,
          Germany, and Spain. In the FIFA World Rankings, in force since August
          1993, Italy has occupied first place several times, in November 1993
          and during 2007 (February, April-June, September), with its worst
          placement in August 2018 in 21st place.
