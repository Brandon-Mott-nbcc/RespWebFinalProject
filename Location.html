          Italy is a country located in Southern Europe, also considered part of
          western Europe.Italy is in the Central European Standard Time Zone, It
          is bordered by France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia to the north
          and consists of the Italian Peninsula and the islands of Sicily and
          Sardinia to the south, as well as many smaller islands. The country's
          total area is 301,230 square kilometers, with a coastline and border
          of 7,600 kilometers on the Adriatic, Ionian, and Tyrrhenian seas. It
          also shares borders with France, Austria, Slovenia, and Switzerland.
          The enclaves of San Marino and the Vatican City are within Italy,
          while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland. Over 35%
          of Italy's territory is mountainous, with the Apennine Mountains
          forming the backbone of the peninsula and the Alps forming most of the
          northern boundary. Italy is also home to many small volcanic islands
          and active volcanoes, including Mount Etna, Vulcano, Stromboli, and
          Vesuvius.

          Italy has a history of environmental problems, but it has made efforts
          to improve and now ranks 84th worldwide for ecological sustainability.
          National parks cover about 5% of the country. In contrast, the total
          area protected by national parks, regional parks, and nature reserves
          covers about 10.5% of the Italian territory and 12% of the coasts
          protected by marine protected areas. In the past decade, Italy has
          become a leading producer of renewable energy, ranking as the
          fourth-largest holder of installed solar energy capacity and the
          sixth-largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010. Renewable
          energies provided approximately 37% of Italy's energy consumption in
          2020. However, the country still faces air pollution and traffic
          congestion issues, particularly in the industrialized north. Italy is
          also the twelfth-largest carbon dioxide producer and has faced
          contamination of watercourses and coastal areas due to industrial and
          agricultural activity. Waste from industrial actions is sometimes not
          correctly disposed of, leading to health effects on affected
          communities. Italy operated nuclear reactors until 1990, but the
          program was terminated after the Chornobyl disaster and a referendum.
          In 2008, the government attempted to build up to four nuclear power
          plants with French technology, but a referendum following the
          Fukushima nuclear accident struck this down. Deforestation, illegal
          building developments, and poor land management have caused
          significant erosion and ecological disasters in Italy's mountainous
          regions. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean
          score of 3.65/10, ranking it 142nd globally out of 172 countries.

          Italy has a high level of faunal biodiversity, with over 57,000
          species recorded, representing more than a third of all European
          fauna. The country has a diverse climate and habitat due to its
          location on the Mediterranean Sea and its varied geological structure,
          including the Alps and the Apennines. Italy is home to 4,777 endemic
          animal species, including the Sardinian long-eared bat, Sardinian red
          deer, and the Italian newt. There are also 119 mammal species, 550
          bird species, 69 reptile species, 39 amphibian species, 623 fish
          species, and 56,213 invertebrate species, including 37,303 insect
          species. Italy has 6,759 recorded vascular plant species, with 1,371
          endemic species and subspecies, such as the Sicilian Fir and the
          Ucriana violet. Italy is a signatory to conservation conventions and
          directives that protect its fauna and flora, and it has many botanical
          and historic gardens. The Italian wolf is the national animal, and the
          strawberry tree is the national tree.

          Italy has a Mediterranean climate, with local variations due to the
          country's geomorphology and the influence of the Mediterranean Sea.
          Inland regions have a subtropical to humid continental and oceanic
          climate, while coastal areas have mild winters and hot, dry summers.
          The Po valley region has a humid subtropical climate, with cool
          winters and hot summers. Average winter temperatures range from 0 °C
          (32 °F) in the Alps to 12 °C (54 °F) in Sicily, and average summer
          temperatures range from 20 °C (68 °F) to over 25 °C (77 °F). Northern
          and central regions can experience thunderstorms from spring to
          autumn.
