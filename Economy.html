          Insular Italy (Italian: Italia insulare or just Isole, meaning
          "islands") is one of the five official statistical regions of Italy
          used by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), a first level
          NUTS region and a European Parliament constituency. Insular Italy
          encompasses two of the country's 20 regions: Sardinia and Sicily.
          Italy's insular region takes up about one-sixth of the country's total
          land area. Both of these islands have several smaller islands and
          archipelagos that are administratively dependent on them. Sicily is
          the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, with an area of 25,708
          square kilometers, and Sardinia is slightly smaller, with an area of
          24,090 square kilometers. The lowlands in this region are generally
          confined to narrow coastal strips, with the exceptions being the
          Campidano and Nurra in Sardinia and the Plain of Catania in Sicily,
          which are 1200 square kilometers and 430 square kilometers,
          respectively. The majority of the land in this region is hilly, with
          hills covering about 70% of the territory. Sicily is home to Mount
          Etna, the highest non-Alpine peak in Italy and the largest active
          volcano in Europe, while Sardinia is home to the Gennargentu mountain
          range.

          Venice is a city located in northeastern Italy and the capital of the
          Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are
          connected by more than 400 bridges and separated by canals. These
          islands are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay
          between the mouths of the Po and Piave rivers. In 2020, about 258,685
          people lived in Venice, or the Comune di Venezia, with about 55,000 of
          them residing in the historic island city of Venice (Centro Storico)
          and the rest living on the mainland (terraferma). Along with the
          cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the
          Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which has a total
          population of 2.6 million people. The name Venice comes from the
          ancient Veneti people who lived in the region in the 10th century BC.
          The city was the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a
          millennium, from 697 to 1797. During this time, it was a major
          financial and maritime power, as well as a center of commerce and art.
          It also played a role in the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto.
          Venice was the first international financial center and reached its
          peak of prominence in the 14th century. Throughout its history, Venice
          had many territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian
          peninsula, which left a lasting impact on its architecture and
          culture. In 1797, Napoleon ended the city's sovereignty, and in 1866,
          it became part of the Kingdom of Italy.
