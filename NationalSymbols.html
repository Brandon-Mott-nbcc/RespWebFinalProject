            The Italian flag, known as il Tricolore, consists of three vertical
            stripes of equal size in the colors green, white, and red. The flag
            is protected by law and is used in the teaching of national symbols
            in Italian schools. The Tricolour Day, a celebration of the flag,
            takes place on January 7th and commemorates the first official
            adoption of the flag by the Cispadane Republic in 1797. The flag
            played a significant role in the unification of Italy and is now a
            defining symbol of the country.

            The Italian wolf, a subspecies of grey wolf native to the Italian
            Peninsula, is known for its cultural significance in Latin and
            Italian cultures and is informally considered the national animal of
            Italy. It is found in the Apennine Mountains and Western Alps, and
            has recently expanded to parts of France and Switzerland. The
            Italian wolf has been protected in Italy since the 1970s, when its
            population was at a low of 70-100 individuals. It is now estimated
            to have a population of 1500-2000 individuals, but illegal hunting
            and persecution remain a threat. The Italian wolf is distinguished
            by its unique mtDNA haplotype and skull morphology.

            Arbutus unedo is an evergreen shrub or small tree in the family
            Ericaceae, native to the Mediterranean and western Europe. The tree
            is well known for its fruits, which resemble the strawberry — hence
            the common name "strawberry tree.” However, it is not closely
            related to the actual strawberries of Fragaria. Its presence in
            Ireland also lends it the moniker "Irish strawberry tree,” or cain,
            or cane apple (from the Irish name for the tree, caithne), or
            sometimes "Killarney strawberry tree.” The strawberry tree is the
            national tree of Italy because of its green leaves, its white
            flowers, and its red berries, colors that recall the Italian flag.
            The strawberry tree began to be considered one of the national
            symbols of Italy in the 19th century, during the Italian
            unification.
