          Leonardo da Vinci was a famous Italian Renaissance artist, known for
          his paintings, drawings, and notes on various subjects. He is
          considered a genius and one of the greatest painters in history, and
          his works, including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, are iconic. Da
          Vinci also made numerous technological inventions, including flying
          machines and concentrated solar power, but most were not feasible at
          the time. He made significant discoveries in various fields, but did
          not publish them and had little impact on science.

          Donatello was a renowned Florentine sculptor of the Renaissance who
          studied classical sculpture and used it to create a new Renaissance
          style. He traveled to other cities, where he worked on commissions and
          taught others, and his techniques were introduced to other parts of
          Italy. With financial support from Cosimo de Medici, Donatello created
          the first freestanding male nude sculpture since antiquity, the famous
          statue of David. He worked with various materials, including stone,
          bronze, wood, clay, stucco, and wax, and had several assistants.
          Donatello is known for his statues in the round, but he also created
          shallow bas-reliefs for more minor works and large architectural
          reliefs.

          Michelangelo was a prominent Italian Renaissance artist known for his
          sculptures, paintings, architecture, and poetry. He was inspired by
          classical models and significantly impacted Western art. Michelangelo
          is considered a quintessential Renaissance man, along with his
          contemporary Leonardo da Vinci. He is one of the most well-documented
          artists of the 16th century, and his biographers praised him as the
          most accomplished artist of his time. Michelangelo achieved fame early
          with his sculptures of Pietà and David and is known for his
          influential frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome and
          on the altar wall of The Last Judgment. He also designed the
          Laurentian Library and was the architect of St. Peter's Basilica in
          Rome. Michelangelo's work was admired for its ability to evoke a sense
          of awe in viewers, and his style influenced the rise of Mannerism.

          Raphael was a famous Italian painter and architect during the High
          Renaissance. He is known for the clarity and ease of composition in
          his work, as well as his depiction of the Neoplatonic ideal of human
          grandeur. Along with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael is
          considered one of the three great masters of the period. He had a
          productive career, running a large workshop and completing a
          significant amount of work before his early death at 37. Raphael's
          career can be divided into three phases and styles: his early years in
          Umbria, a period in Florence where he absorbed artistic traditions,
          and his final years in Rome working for two popes. Many of his works
          can be found in the Vatican Palace, including the famous fresco The
          School of Athens. After his death, Raphael's work had a significant
          influence on Neoclassical painting, although it was later rejected by
          groups like the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Raphael's father was a
          court painter and Raphael took over the family workshop after his
          father's death. He trained in the workshop of Perugino and became a
          fully qualified master by 1500. He worked in various cities in
          northern Italy before moving to Rome in 1508 to work at the Vatican
          Palace. He also worked as an architect in Rome and continued to create
          important works until his death in 1520.

          The Colosseum is an oval amphitheater in the center of Rome, Italy,
          just east of the Roman Forum. Despite its age, it is the largest
          ancient amphitheater ever built and is still the largest standing
          amphitheater today. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r.
          69-79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and
          heir, Titus (r. 79-81). Further modifications were made during the
          reign of Domitian. The three emperors that were patrons of the work
          are known as the Flavian dynasty. The amphitheater was named the
          Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its
          association with their family name (Flavius). The Colosseum is built
          of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced
          concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at
          various points in its history, having an average audience of some
          65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles,
          including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles,
          and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The
          building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval
          era. It was later reused for housing, workshops, quarters for a
          religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.

          The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is an 18th-century
          fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian
          architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several
          others. Standing 26.3 meters (86 ft) high and 49.15 meters (161.3 ft)
          wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the
          most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in
          several films, including Roman Holiday; Three Coins in the Fountain;
          Federico Fellini's classic, La Dolce Vita; Sabrina Goes to Rome; and
          The Lizzie McGuire Movie.

          The Roman Forum, also known as the Forum Romanum, is a rectangular
          plaza surrounded by the ruins of ancient government buildings in Rome.
          It was initially a marketplace and served as the center of daily life
          in Rome, with triumphal processions, elections, public speeches,
          criminal trials, gladiatorial matches, and commercial activities all
          taking place there. The Forum also had many statues and monuments
          honoring Rome's notable figures. Today, the Forum is a ruin with
          intermittent archaeological excavations, attracting millions of
          tourists yearly. Rome's oldest and most essential structures were
          located on or near the Forum, including the Regia, the Temple of
          Vesta, and the Vestal Virgins complex.

          The Sistine Chapel is located in the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City
          and serves as the pope's official residence. It was built by Pope
          Sixtus IV between 1473 and 1481 and named after him. The chapel is
          famous for its frescoes, especially the ceiling and The Last Judgment
          by Michelangelo. It is also the site of the papal conclave, where a
          new pope is selected. During the reign of Sixtus IV, a team of
          Renaissance painters, including Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino,
          Pinturicchio, and Domenico Ghirlandaio, painted frescoes depicting the
          Life of Moses and the Life of Christ, along with papal portraits and
          trompe-l'œil drapery. These paintings were completed in 1482, and the
          chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary during a
          ceremony on the Feast of the Assumption. Between 1508 and 1512,
          Michelangelo painted the chapel's ceiling under the patronage of Pope
          Julius II. This project, considered one of the significant artistic
          achievements in human history, changed the course of Western art.
          Michelangelo also painted The Last Judgment for Popes Clement VII and
          Paul III between 1535 and 1541. The fame of Michelangelo's paintings
          has attracted many visitors to the chapel over the past five
          centuries.

          The history of Italy covers the ancient period, the Middle Ages, and
          the modern era. Since classical antiquity, ancient Etruscans, various
          Italic peoples (such as the Latins, Samnites, and Umbri), Celts, Magna
          Graecia colonists, and other ancient peoples have inhabited the
          Italian Peninsula. In antiquity, Italy was the homeland of the Romans
          and the metropole of the Roman Empire's provinces. Rome was founded as
          a Kingdom in 753 BC and became a republic in 509 BC when the Roman
          monarchy was overthrown in favor of a government of the Senate and the
          People. The Roman Republic then unified Italy at the expense of the
          peninsula's Etruscans, Celts, and Greek colonists. Rome led Socii, a
          confederation of the Italic peoples, and later with the rise of Rome,
          dominated Western Europe, Northern Africa, and the Near East. The
          Roman Republic saw its fall after the assassination of Julius Caesar.
          The Roman Empire later dominated Western Europe and the Mediterranean
          for many centuries, making immeasurable contributions to Western
          philosophy, science, and art development. After the fall of Rome in AD
          476, Italy was fragmented into numerous city-states and regional
          polities; despite seeing famous personalities from its territory and
          closely related ones (such as Dante Alighieri, Leonardo da Vinci,
          Michelangelo, Niccolò Machiavelli, Galileo Galilei, and Napoleon
          Bonaparte) rise, it remained politically divided to a large extent.
          The maritime republics, particularly Venice and Genoa, rose to great
          prosperity through shipping, commerce, and banking, acting as Europe's
          main port of entry for Asian and Near Eastern imported goods and
          laying the groundwork for capitalism. Central Italy remained under the
          Papal States, while Southern Italy remained essentially feudal due to
          a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and Bourbon crowns.
          The Italian Renaissance spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a
          renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art with the
          start of the modern era. Italian explorers (including Marco Polo,
          Christopher Columbus (Italian: Cristoforo Colombo), and Amerigo
          Vespucci) discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World,
          helping to usher in the Age of Discovery, although the Italian states
          had no occasion to found colonial empires outside of the Mediterranean
          Basin. By the mid-19th century, the Italian unification by Giuseppe
          Garibaldi, backed by the Kingdom of Sardinia, led to the establishment
          of an Italian nation-state. The new Kingdom of Italy, established in
          1861, quickly modernized and built a colonial empire, controlling
          parts of Africa and countries along the Mediterranean. At the same
          time, Southern Italy remained rural and poor, originating the Italian
          diaspora. In World War I, Italy completed the unification by acquiring
          Trento and Trieste and gained a permanent seat in the League of
          Nations' executive council. Italian nationalists considered World War
          I a mutilated victory because Italy did not have all the territories
          promised by the Treaty of London (1915). That sentiment led to the
          rise of the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini in 1922. The
          subsequent participation in World War II with the Axis powers,
          together with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan, ended in military
          defeat, Mussolini's arrest and escape (aided by the German dictator
          Adolf Hitler), and the Italian Civil War between the Italian
          Resistance (aided by the Kingdom, now a co-belligerent of the Allies)
          and a Nazi-fascist puppet state known as the Italian Social Republic.
          Following the liberation of Italy, the fall of the Social Republic,
          and the killing of Mussolini at the hands of the Resistance, the 1946
          Italian constitutional referendum abolished the monarchy and became a
          republic, reinstated democracy, enjoyed an economic miracle, and
          founded the European Union (Treaty of Rome), NATO, and the Group of
          Six (later G7 and G20). It remains a strong economic, cultural,
          military, and political factor in the 21st century.
